    <h1>Shane Fleming's Digital Resume</h1>
    <body>
        <div id="homepage"> 
            <h2>What is the goal(s) of your portfolio website?</h2>
            <p>I want to create a digital resume for potential employers. Basically, I will be building out my current resume and digital form.
                When this project is complete, <br>I would love to be able to share it with potential employers. I want to be able to provide real 
                links to actual projects I've worked on so they can get a good idea of my experience.
            </p>

            <h2>Who is the target audience for your portfolio?</h2>
            <p>My target audience for this project will be potential employers. I just finished <br> 
            my resume and I am looking at keeping my options open in terms of long-term career possibilities. <br>
            I think it would be great and I would stand out a bit if I were to send them something like this.</p>

        <div id="idustry">
            <h2>What information is most important for your audience to see?</h2>
            <p>I believe that all the information is a typical resume would be good to see. I think it will also be <br>
            great to have real links to projects. In my success page, I am going to link to some of the actual projects I've worked on. <br>
            I think it will also be really important to emphazise my idustry specific skills; that will speak more to my target audience.</p>

            <h2>How will your page layout or design elements help to achieve your portfolio goals?</h2>
            <p>I want to make this digital resume closely resemble an standard resume - however, the difference will be in functionality. <br>
            Containing certain elements and playing with the design will be great - but I think showing off some of the real projects I've worked on <br>
            and making it easy to access those projects will be very beneficial</p>
